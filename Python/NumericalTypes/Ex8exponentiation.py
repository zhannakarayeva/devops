# Exponansiation helps us to find power of numbers.
# 3 exponents 4 -> 3*3*3*3
# 2 to power of 3 -> 2*2*2
# square of 4 -> 4*4
# cube of 5 -> 5*5*5


# ** means exponent    <---this is 2 asterics
print(4**3) #4*4*4 -> 64
print(3**2) #3*3 ->9
#There is a cube with a side length 11 using Python calculate the value of the cube and 
# formula for calculating the value find the cube of the side

print(11**3)  #cube is actialy multiplication of 3 times !!!
