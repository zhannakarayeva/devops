# In the farm we have 35 cows , 23 chickens,
# #and 40 ducks.
# Create a program to calculate total number of
# legs in the farm
# #Requirements create a variable for 
# cows, chickens and ducks , and create variables
# #for their number of legs. 
# print "We have 'result' legs in the farm"


cows=35
chicken=23
ducks=40
cowsLegs=4
chickenLegs=2
ducksLegs=2
total=((cows*chickenLegs)+(chicken*chickenLegs)+(ducks*ducksLegs))
print(total)
print("We have", total, " legs in the farm")
#NOTE: Python is gonna add space when comma is used in print frunction.
