#we are asked to create a program to calculate avarage score for a student with exam score following:
#1-70
#2-95
#3-50
#4-45
#Calculate the avarage score for the student 
#and print average in following format
#average score for given student grades is 'avgScore'

student1=70
student2=95
student3=50
student4=45
avgScore=(student1+student2+student3+student4)/4
print("average score for given student grades is",avgScore)


#To find avarage we need to divide total to number of students

#type() function
#when we put the variable name in a type function it will show the type of a variable
print(type(avgScore))


student1,student2,student3,student4=70,95,50,45
