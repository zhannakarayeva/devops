A variable in programming is like a container where we can store the data.

Why do we use variables?
1.Storage
  Variables allows us to store data that we can use and modify later
2.Readability
  Makes our code easier to understand and debug and find what the data represents.
  *Debug mostly means goig over the code again for the purpose of understanding and find the mistake.
3.Reusability
  Once the value is stored in variable , you can use that variable multiple times in different parts of your code.



Formulula of the Variable Creation
variableName = value

Naming a Variable 
  Rules:
   Variable name cannot start with number.
   It can not have spaces
   It can only contain alphanumeric characters (_) or camelCase.
      *alphanumeric: numbers and letters
   Variable names are case sensative which means 'age' is not same as 'Age'.

Naming Conventions
   * Conventions -> how do you name the variable.
There are 4 different types of naming conventions:
   1. camelCase  --> helloWorld, firstName, lastName     <--Java Users
   2. PascalCase --> UpperCase, FirstName, lastName
   3. SnakeCase  --> snake_case, first_name, last_name   <--Python Users
   4. Kebab Case --> snake-case, first-name, last-name 

NOTE: When creating the variable type of variable is auto understood by python.

Type of Numerical Variables:
   1. Integer:Represents whole numbers. Ex: age=25
   2. Float: Represents real numbers. (Numbers with decimal points.)  Ex: weight=190.4, avg = 8.0
   3. Complex: Represents complex numbers that both imaginary and real parts. Ex: 25--root--5;  16--root--4; 0--root--0

Type Function
  The type () function is a built-in Python function.Used to determine the data type of a variable.
  Ex: a=10
      print(type(a)) #output <class 'int'>
      b=10.1
      print(type(a)) #output <class 'float'>
Importance:
   Help debugging
   Useful when learning because it helps you to understand how python works with data types.

Creating mMultiple Variables in a Single Line
   We can define multiple variables in single line by separating them with the commas(,)
   Syntax: a,b,c = 1.1, 1, "h"

Advantage:
  Reduce the line of your code 
  More readable 
  Compact code 

Assigning Multiple Variables With A Same Value 
  Ex: a=b=c=d=5
  In the line above variable a,b,c,d will be assigned with the value 5 and type of all Variables will be int

ReAssignment in Python:
  After Variables assigned with the value we can assign a new value to them also 
  Ex: var1=6
      var1=10
      print(var1)    and the result is going to 10
