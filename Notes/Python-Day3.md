# Operator Precedence
- Order of evaluation for the operators. Each operator will be executed 
in different time even they are in the same line. 

### Precedence
- **1**. Parenthesis 
- **2**. Exponentiation
- **3**. Remainder(Modulus), Division, Multiplication
- **4**. Addition, Subtraction

#### Note! If the operators have the same precedence they will be evaluated 
#### from left to right. 
           
-- `3 + 7 * 2 - 10 + 10 / 1 -> `

##### Note! When in doubt you can use paranthesis to make sure 
##### things are evaluated in  order you wanted. 


# Reassignment in Python
In Python variables are simply names pointing to objects.
Reassignment reffers to changing the object a variable points to after its initial assignment
```python
var1="s"
print(var1) #s
var1=10 #this is the reassignment.
print(var1) #10
```

### Compound reassignment operators in python
Compound assignment operators are shortcuts that combine a basic operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. with reassignment. 

- **`+=`**:  Add the value on the right side and reassign it. 
- **`-=`**:  Subtract the value on the right side and reassign it. 
- **`*=`**:  Multiply the value and then reassign it
- **`/=`**:  Divide the value and then reassign it.
- **`%=`**:  Find the remainder and then reassign it.
- **`**=`**: Exponentiate the value and then reassign it.

**+=**

python
x = 5
x += 10 # same as x = x + 10
print(x) #15
**-=**
python
x = 5
x -= 10 # same as x = x - 10
print(x) # -5
**\*=**
python
x = 5
x = 10 # same as x = x 10
print(x) # 50
**/=**
python
x = 5
x /= 10 # same as x = x / 10
print(x) # 0.5
**%=**
python
x = 5
x %= 10 # same as x = x % 10
print(x) # 5
**\*\*=**
python
x = 5
x = 3 # same as x = x  3
print(x) # 5 * 5 * 5 -> 125
